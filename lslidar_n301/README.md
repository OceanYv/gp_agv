## Example Usage

### lslidar_n301_driver

**Parameters**

`device_ip` (`string`, `default: 192.168.1.222`)

By default, the IP address of the device is 192.168.1.222.

`frame_id` (`string`, `default: lslidar`)

The frame ID entry for the sent messages.

**Published Topics**

`lslidar_packets` (`lslidar_n301_msgs/LslidarN301Packet`)

Each message corresponds to a lslidar packet sent by the device through the Ethernet.

### lslidar_n301_decoder

**Parameters**

`min_range` (`double`, `0.3`)

`max_range` (`double`, `100.0`)

Points outside this range will be removed.

`frequency` (`frequency`, `20.0`)

Note that the driver does not change the frequency of the sensor. 

`publish_point_cloud` (`bool`, `false`)

If set to true, the decoder will additionally send out a local point cloud consisting of the points in each revolution.

**Published Topics**

`lslidar_sweep` (`lslidar_n301_msgs/LslidarN301Sweep`)

The message arranges the points within each sweep based on its scan index and azimuth.

`lslidar_point_cloud` (`sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`)

This is only published when the `publish_point_cloud` is set to `true` in the launch file.

**Node**

```
roslaunch lslidar_n301_decoder lslidar_n301.launch
```

Note that this launch file launches both the driver and the decoder, which is the only launch file needed to be used.
